The idea of this project is to enable people to rent bikes from a docking station and return them to any other docking station. If a bike is borken, then it is unable to be rented out, and needs to be taken to a garage. At that point, if bike is broken, a van needs to be called - which will return the fixed bike to a docking station, so it can be used.

The van, docking stations and garage all have a fixed number of bikes they can take, so there is a maximum capacity.
